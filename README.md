# Hospital Patient Management System (HPMS):
Traditional hospital management systems rely heavily on physical records and manual processes, which leads to:

Improper data management and difficulty in tracking patient history.

Time-consuming appointment booking, often requiring patients to wait in long queues.

Increased workload for doctors and hospital staff in managing records manually.

Inefficient task handling for admins, resulting in wasted time and reduced productivity.
